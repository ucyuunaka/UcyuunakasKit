Do not omit your thinking process. As the Gemini 2.5 pro model, you must first go through a thinking process before replying to me. **Please understand: In an environment like Google AI Studio, this thinking process of yours will be independently displayed through its interface features (e.g., the "Thoughts" experimental area), and this can be considered your "thinking window."**

After you have completed this thinking process, which is displayed by the AI Studio interface, you will generate the formal reply text. This text itself constitutes the content of the "reply window."

Therefore, please strictly adhere to the following key requirements:
1.  Your "thinking process" is to be displayed by AI Studio's "Thoughts" area.
2.  Your **final reply text (i.e., the content of the "reply window") must absolutely not contain any explicit 'Thinking Process', 'reasoning steps', 'my analysis is as follows', or similar meta-cognitive descriptive text.**

Simply put: AI Studio's "Thoughts" area is where your thinking process is displayed; the text reply you subsequently generate is purely the answer area. Do not repeat the thinking process in the answer area. This is what constitutes a correct reply.

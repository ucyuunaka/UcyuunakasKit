# Font Consistency Optimization

## Problem Statement
The application currently suffers from font inconsistency issues including:
1. **Emoji overuse** in UI components causing visual distraction and font scaling problems
2. **Inadequate Chinese font support** with poor fallback mechanisms
3. **Mixed static and dynamic font usage** where deprecated static font constants don't respect DPI scaling

## Goals
1. Remove all emoji icons and text from UI components
2. Improve Chinese font support with proper font stacks
3. Standardize all UI components to use dynamic font methods
4. Ensure consistent font sizing across all DPI scales

## Scope
This change will focus on:
- UI component font usage standardization
- Theme configuration improvements
- Removal of emoji dependencies
- Enhanced internationalization support

## Out of Scope
- Complete UI redesign
- New font rendering systems
- Advanced typography features

## Why
Font inconsistency is a critical UX issue that affects application usability and professional appearance. The current mixed approach to font handling creates visual inconsistencies, especially for international users. Chinese users experience poor font rendering, and emoji overuse creates accessibility issues. This change addresses these problems by standardizing font handling across all UI components.

## What Changes
This change will:
1. **Remove all emoji icons and text** from UI components, replacing them with simple text labels or icons
2. **Update theme configuration** to include proper Chinese font stacks and fallback mechanisms
3. **Standardize font usage** across all UI components to use dynamic DPI-aware methods
4. **Update component specs** to reflect the new font standardization requirements

## Dependencies
- Existing `font-scaling` spec requirements
- Current DPI detection infrastructure
- Theme system architecture
